The inspiration for this project was born while my wife and I did a local coffee crawl in San Diego and had trouble finding some of the roasters on the coffee map and the applications we found were unhelpful and lacked the ability to order from someone the ones we had heard the most about. I hope to create an application that could be used by a local coffee roaster to reach a larger audience.

## <div align="center">Concept</div>

The idea of this project is to create a simple, user friendly tool to order locally roasted coffee. I want this app to be extremely easy to and provide the user with a feeling of broswing through coffee at their local coffee shop. I want it to be aesthetically appealing and functional.

**These are only drafts**

The Login Page would be the first thing that a user is presented with. The user would have the option to enter their User Name and Password, have the option to select forgot password, and sign up for an acount if they don't already have one.

Once logged in the user would be directed to the Featured page which will have the featured roast for that month. Each featured monthly roast will have a picture of the bag of beans, a short description with the size and price, and the ability to add the monthly roast to the cart. underneath the monthly roast there will be a scroller of the coffees for the previous twelve months so you can see which coffees have been featured moving backword.

If the user presses one of the links in the top menu they will be directed to that page. I only made a wireframe for one of the links, as each one of the links will direct the user to a similar page just with different products depending on the link that they clicked. The user simiply scrolls through the list of coffess like Instagram and clicks the picture to bring the user to a page similar to the Featured Page where there is a discription of the coffee and the ability to order that particualr roast.

Finally once the user has made there selections they can go to the cart and checkout. Once they click the checkout button they will be directed to a third party site that would finish the payment and send an email to both the roastery and the customer with the details and shipping information.
